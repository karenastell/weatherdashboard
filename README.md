Weather Dashboard

This project allows the user to enter a city and select a state to find access weather data. Upon click of the search button, the user will see the current weather and the 5 day forecast. There will also be a button added to the search history, that can be clicked to go back to that weather. Upon page load, the user will find the weater for the last city/state they searched for. If the user would like, they can click the "clear search history" button and it will clear the buttons and clear their search history from local storage - although, this will not allow the last weather to be brought up upon page re-load.

This project was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bulma, and the Open Weather API.
